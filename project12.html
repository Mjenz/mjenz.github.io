        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project focuses on the implementation of the A* algorithm to generate optimal 2-D paths for a differential-drive robot. 
            The robot navigates through a discretized environment represented by occupancy grids, avoiding obstacles while moving from start to goal locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond static path planning, the project explores <strong>Online A*</strong>, where the robot plans without prior knowledge of all obstacles, 
            and a low-level <strong>Bang-Bang Controller</strong> to drive the generated waypoints under simulated noise.

        <h2>Environment: Occupancy Grids</h2>
        <p>
            To utilize discrete search algorithms in a continuous world, the environment is discretized into occupancy grids. 
            Two resolutions were tested: a standard 1.0m grid and a high-resolution 0.1m grid.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discretization</strong>: Each cell represents the binary state of being occupied or free.</li>
            <li><strong>Obstacle Inflation</strong>: In high-resolution grids, obstacles were inflated to ensure the robot maintains a safe distance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The A* Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
            The A* algorithm uses an evaluation function \(f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\) to find the cost-optimal path. 
            I utilized <strong>Euclidean distance</strong> as an admissible heuristic, ensuring the algorithm never overestimates the cost to the goal.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
            \[
            \begin{aligned}
            g(n) &= \text{cost to reach node } n \\
            h(n) &= \sqrt{(x_{goal} - x_n)^2 + (y_{goal} - y_n)^2}
            \end{aligned}
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Offline vs. Online:</strong> The offline version prunes unnecessary nodes after reaching the goal. 
            The online version assumes the robot only senses adjacent obstacles, requiring real-time path adjustments as it moves through the environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Motion Control</h2>
        <p>
            The low-level controller implements a <strong>state machine</strong> using bang-bang control for linear and rotational motion. 
            The robot first rotates to minimize <strong>heading error</strong> before moving forward to the target waypoint.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">
            \[
            \text{heading error} = \operatorname{atan2}(y_{goal} - y, x_{goal} - x) - \theta
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            To simulate real-world conditions, random noise was applied to the robot's configuration [x, y, θ], 
            forcing the controller to constantly compensate for drift and sensor uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
  
            To avod obstacle collission, my offline A* implementation filters paths between cells such that they do not clip the edges of obstacles.

        <h2>Alternative: Potential Fields</h2>
        <p>
            As an alternative to discrete grids, I implemented <strong>Potential Fields</strong> to navigate in continuous space. 
            The goal is modeled as a 3D Gaussian distribution with positive amplitude, while obstacles act as negative peaks, creating a "force" that guides the robot.

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>
            This project highlighted the critical trade-offs between grid resolution and computational cost. 
            While high-resolution grids offer more precision, they require robust inflation layers and precise control to prevent the robot from colliding with obstacles during noisy execution.
